/**
 * One of your friends is going to the San Diego Comic Con and he need to load a van with 234 books
 * of a comic encyclopedia, organized in expositors that can hold 13 books each.
The books are really heavy and he needs your help: he can't offer you money,
but if there are books that cannot fill completely an expositor, you can  take them.
The offer seems good, but what if there aren't remaining books?
You use your newly acquired knowledge of the modulo operation
to make a quick check you will reive your prize.

First calculate how many full expositors you can fill with the integer divison.
Then check how many books you can take with the modulo operation.
Mhh, something fishy here!
