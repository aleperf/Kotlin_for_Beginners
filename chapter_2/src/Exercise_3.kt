/**
 * After the previous exercises you finally have a good number of books to read,
 * but you are a really busy person (learning Kotlin takes its time)
 * and you have only 30 minutes a day to read. If a book has 1000 pages
 * and you know that you can read 50 pages in an hour (you are an avid comic reader),
 * how many months plus remainng days you need to read all the booksm,
 * considering a month as made of 30 days?
 *
 * Calculate how many books you can read in 30 minutes.
Divide the pages in a book for the number of pages you can read in 30 minutes to get the total days.
Multiplicate the days for the number of volumes you have (you know it from the previous problem).
Divide the total number of days for 30 using integer division
to know how many months you need to read all the books.
Use the modulo operations to know how many reamaining days you need to read all the books!
