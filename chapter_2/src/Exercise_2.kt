He has only exactly 85 minutes to load the van and leave, he can't wait a single minute more,
and it takes 5 minutes to load an expositor of books and put it on the van .
You can take all the books he cannot load on the van.
Will you get some book now?
Use integer division for calculating how many expositors you can load on the van.
Use subtraction to know how many expositors you can take.
