  TODO: add \n to sentences in order to add newlines (or carriage returns) in the appropriate places
   and then print a sentence with newlines using only a single print() statement.
   As example, see below how the following sentences has been coded with \n inside print()

   Roses are red,
   Violets are blue,
   Programming is fun,
   Let's try everyone!

   Your task is to use print, to write the following in a similar way, with the same newlines:
    I'm programming
    using the Kotlin
    programming language.

    print("Roses are red,\nViolets are blue,\nProgramming is fun,\nLet's try everyone!")
