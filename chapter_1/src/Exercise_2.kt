/*
  TODO: write a main() function and inside the main function use the print function()
  to write :
  "Kotlin is a modern programming language".

  Under this first printing statement, use print() again for printing:

  "There is room for everyone in the programming world".

  Observe the output in the console: despite the fact that there is room for everyone in the programming world,
  there is no room between the two sentences!
  Why?
  print() is a function that prints what is between parenthesis, but it doesn't add any new line at the end.
  println() instead adds always a new line at the end of every sentence.
